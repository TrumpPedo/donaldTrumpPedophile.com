2. You have to request a vote-by-mail ballot. There are a lot of ways to do it outlined <a href="https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/vote-by-mail/">here</a>. You can do it online, but you have to find your specific county Supervisor of Elections. It takes about 15 minutes, don't worry! Start <a href="https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/supervisors/">HERE</a>. Pick your county, it will provide a link to your county's website. For example, if you're in Miami-Dade, your website is: <a href="https://www.miamidade.gov/global/elections/home.page">https://www.miamidade.gov/global/elections/home.page</a>. When you get to that page, look for a link to request your mail-in ballot. Remember, Florida is a red state, and that means the politicians will try to make this confusing for you. Don't give up!
