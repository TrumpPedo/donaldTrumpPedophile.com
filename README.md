# donaldTrumpPedophile.com
This is a ridiculously basic and ugly site meant to publicize allegations against Donald Trump and to encourage Americans to lawfully have their voices heard by getting their votes counted.

# Do you want to help out?
I suck at webdev, so ... all help appreciated! Have an idea on how we can organize a super repository of a bunch of sites people can just copy and host? Want to make this site not look like a jr high project? How about a better set of instructions for your state or county? Maybe you'd like to make some banners I can use in my Facebook campaigns? All help wanted! Submit pull requests, email me (TrumpThePedo@gmail.com), hell ... fire off the bat signal and I might see it and show up  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
